# DNS/WHOIS Lookup Tool

This tool allows you to obtain DNS information for a given domain using Google's Public DNS resolver. It also provides WHOIS information for the domain using [whoisxmlapi.com](https://whoisxmlapi.com/).

## Usage

2. Click on the "Obtain DNS and WHOIS Information" button.

## Future Improvements

3. Improve the user interface and add error handling.
4. Cache results to reduce API calls.
5. Add support for bulk domain lookups.
